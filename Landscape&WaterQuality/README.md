#### Overview:
This repository hosts the database developed for the study "Long-term Land Use Land Cover change and nutrient exports across Puerto Rico’s watersheds (1951–2010)". The paper investigates how 60 years of LULC change influenced nitrogen and phosphorus loads and concentrations across 42 watersheds, linking decadal land cover dynamics with water quality monitoring data and landscape configuration metrics.

We are sharing:

Database file: Landscape and Water Quality Database.xlsx – includes data on LULC proportions, landscape metrics, and nutrient concentrations/loads across scales.

Metadata file: Landscape and Water Quality Metadata.xlsx – describes each column in the database, including units and definitions.

This dataset provides a resource for exploring how long-term land use change and spatial patterns shape water quality outcomes, with emphasis on scale-dependent and nutrient-specific dynamics.
