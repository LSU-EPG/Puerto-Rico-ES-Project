# Puerto-Rico-ES-Project

## Project Background
Climate change presents new challenges for Puerto Rico’s costal watersheds, both in terms of
water quality stressors, water availability, and hazardsrelated to extreme storm events, sea level
rise, and flooding (NCA 2018, Gould et al 2018). The processes that exacerbate or help
mitigate these expected climate change impacts occur primarily at watershed scale, a spatial
level that transcends local jurisdictions, and involves actors across a multitude of sectors, and
often with conflicting priorities and needs. Planning for coastal resilience, and the
management of waterresources of importance to the coast, requiresintegrative watershed scale
planning and collaboration. Watersheds in Puerto Rico are coastal, and planners and policy
makers must be able to understand the spatial linkages between the supply and demand for
watershed services in a proximate coastal and upstream continuum. They must also be able to
visualize and understand how the plans and policies for infrastructure, land use, agriculture,
housing, and transportation jointly and systemically interact with water quality and supply
issues. Here, we propose to contribute to such a strategy. Our approach to better map ecosystem service 
relationships and link them to the planning system will contribute to the Puerto Rico Sea Grant’s goal
developing effective tools and policy responses to mitigate and adapt to climate change
impacts on water quality, as well as other ecosystem services of relevance to coastal resources
such as water quantity, and flood protection.
